Pseudocode:
1. Create an empty array called result
2. Loop through each index i from 0 to string.length - 1
3. For each i, loop through j from i + 1 to string.length
4. Use string.slice(i,j) to extract a substring
5. Push that substring into the result array 
6. After both loops finish, return result

Explanation:
This function takes an input string and returns all possible consecutive substrings.
it uses two nested loops:
- The outer loop picks the starting character
- The inner loop picks the end of each substring (non-inclusive)
- It uses slice(i,j) to extract substrings from start index to end index
- All substrings are stored in an array and returned

Time Complexity: 0(n^2)
Space Complexity: 0(n^2)

Example:
Input: "abc"
Output: ["a", "ab", "abc", "b", "bc", "c"]
